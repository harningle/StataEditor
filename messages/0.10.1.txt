Changes in version 0.10.1:

	*Fixed a bug that caused Stata 15 to launch twice (thanks to Chris Vecchio
	for suggesting the solution!). There is now a 0.5 second delay before 
	commands are being sent to Stata after Stata is launched. The timing of the
	delay can be changed in the user settings file. Setting is only applicable
	for Stata 15 and later.
